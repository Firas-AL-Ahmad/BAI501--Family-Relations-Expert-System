I have successfully created the project structure for the Family Expert System, including all specified directories and empty files.

The following files and directories have been created:
- `family-expert-system/`
- `family-expert-system/family_expert_system.ipynb`
- `family-expert-system/data/`
- `family-expert-system/data/family_facts.csv`
- `family-expert-system/src/`
- `family-expert-system/src/facts.py`
- `family-expert-system/src/rules.py`
- `family-expert-system/src/queries.py`
- `family-expert-system/tests/`
- `family-expert-system/tests/test_relations.py`
- `family-expert-system/requirements.txt`
- `family-expert-system/report.pdf`

=========================================
I have successfully read the content of the PDF file. I have extracted the family table and structured it according to the specified requirements.

Here is the plan to create and populate the `family_facts.csv` file, along with the Python code I intend to use.

I am ready to proceed with creating the `family_facts.csv` file and generating the summary. Please switch to

API Request$0.0100

Thinking:**Generating the CSV File** I've got the Python code primed and ready to go. My focus is on executing this code within the Colab environment to generate the `family_facts.csv` file. Once that's done, I'll print the summary as requested. The switch to ACT mode makes this seem all the more achievable.**Executing the Script** I'm now focused on the execution phase. I've decided to write the Python code directly to a temporary file, run it, and then delete that file. This streamlined approach allows me to create the `family_facts.csv` and print the summary without unnecessary steps. The switch to Google Colab demands this flexible approach to ensure seamless operation.‎

Cline wants to create a new file:

API Request$0.0051

Thinking:**Launching Script Execution** I've successfully set up the `create_family_facts.py` script. The next step involves running it to produce the `family_facts.csv` file, along with printing the summary. The core functionality is now in place and I am moving towards running it.‎

Task Completed

I have successfully created and populated the `family-expert-system/data/family_facts.csv` file with the family data extracted from the PDF. The file adheres to the specified header and formatting rules.

This the response from the task Step 2-B after do it so lets move next as experts


=======================================



Task Completed

I have successfully committed the changes to the Git repository.

I have completed all the requested tasks:

1. Improved spouse counting logic in `src/facts.py` to count unique unordered pairs.
2. Created `SUMMARY.md` with the specified content.
3. Expanded `tests/test_relations.py` with tests for unique spouse counting and PyDatalog fact presence.
4. Ensured all tests pass.
5. Committed the changes with the specified message.

Here are the deliverables:

__1. The small code snippet changed for spouse counting (from `src/facts.py`):__

```python
    # Initialize counters
    summary = {
        "num_fathers": 0,
        "num_mothers": 0,
        "num_spouses": 0, # This will be updated after processing all spouses
        "num_males": 0,
        "num_females": 0,
    }

    # Track unique spouse pairs for accurate counting across all individuals
    unique_spouse_pairs = set()

    # Add facts from DataFrame
    for _, row in df.iterrows():
        person_name = row["Name"]
        gender = row["Gender"]
        father_name = row["Father"]
        mother_name = row["Mother"]
        spouses_str = row["Spouses"]

        # Add gender facts
        if gender == "Male":
            + is_male(person_name)
            summary["num_males"] += 1
        elif gender == "Female":
            + is_female(person_name)
            summary["num_females"] += 1

        # Add father facts
        if father_name:
            + father(person_name, father_name)
            summary["num_fathers"] += 1

        # Add mother facts
        if mother_name:
            + mother(person_name, mother_name)
            summary["num_mothers"] += 1

        # Add spouse facts (symmetric)
        if spouses_str:
            spouses_list = [s for s in spouses_str.split(';') if s and s != person_name]
            for spouse_name in set(spouses_list): # Use set to handle duplicates
                if spouse_name:
                    # Add symmetric facts to PyDatalog
                    + spouse(person_name, spouse_name)
                    + spouse(spouse_name, person_name)

                    # Add to unique_spouse_pairs set (unordered)
                    pair = frozenset({person_name, spouse_name})
                    unique_spouse_pairs.add(pair)

    # Update num_spouses in summary after processing all individuals
    summary["num_spouses"] = len(unique_spouse_pairs)
```

__2. The content of `family-expert-system/SUMMARY.md`:__

```markdown
# Assumptions Made During CSV Construction

*   **Missing Parents:** Represented by an empty string `""`.
*   **Multiple Spouses:** Encoded using a semicolon `;` as a separator within the 'Spouses' column.
*   **Ambiguous/Inconsistent Entries:**
    *   Mark's father being Mark was kept as-is, as per the source data.
*   **Name Normalization:** Names are trimmed of leading/trailing whitespace and multiple internal spaces are collapsed to a single space. Casing is preserved.
*   **Observed Counts:**
    *   Total number of people: 35
    *   Number of males: 17
    *   Number of females: 18
```
